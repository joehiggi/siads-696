Starting a Session with GreatLakes

- Login with your preferred method
	- Windows can use "Putty" (a GUI for the command line interface (CLI))
	- Mac can use zsh (shell)
	- I believe both require the installation of the Cisco VPN
		- Get Connected: https://documentation.its.umich.edu/node/5093
- Once VPN is installed you need to activate it each time you want to start a session with GreatLakes
	- You do this through the Cisco desktop application
	- Select the icon
		- Select the network you wish to join ("UMVPN - Only U-M Traffic")
- Login to GreatLakes
	- From shell `ssh input_your_username@greatlakes.arc-ts.umich.edu` (my username is joehiggi so would be `ssh joehiggi@greatlakes.arc-tes.umich.edu`)


Submitting jobs to GreatLakes (once a session has been started)

- Load "mamba" module with `module load mamba`
	- Documentation: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
		- Mamba is a package manager capabale of spinning up virtual environments
		- Virtual environments are a way of solving the "well it worked on my machine" problem when sharing code on teams
		- It packages all dependenices (down to specific version) of required modules (such as pandas, sklearn etc.) to ensure there are no dependency mismatches
- Activate a virtual environment
	- To activate `mamba activate virtual_env` (virtual_env is a placeholder name)
	- To deactivate `mamba deactivate virtual_env`
