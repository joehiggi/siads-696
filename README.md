# *SIADS 696: Milestone II*
# Foreign Exchange Return Forecasting of Neighboring Countries based on Powerful Anchor Countries

## *By Team 2: Spencer Cheung, Phuc Nguyen and Joey Higgins*

### Overview

*Our team studied the impact on foreign exchange returns between neighboring countries and anchoring countries (neighboring countries with a larger GDP). We studied:*

`H_0` (null): Anchoring country foreign exchange return rates have no impact on foreign exchange return rates of neighboring countries.

`H_1` (alternative): Anchoring country foreign exchange return rates have impact on foreign exchange return rates of neighboring countries.
